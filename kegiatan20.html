    <p> “august” is the eighth track from American country/folk singer Taylor Swift and her eighth studio album “folklore”. “august” was written and produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff and was released on the 24th July 2020.<br>
        <br>“august” is a gloomy pop rock song, making itself stand out amongst the rest of “folklore”, which mainly consists of country and folk songs. It describes a summer romance that ends in heartbreak, detailing how the lovers lost their virginity. Many fans believe that this song is in reference to “betty”, using the same character James, and believe that “august” is told in perspective of the lover that James met in the summer. The co-writer and co-producer Jack Antonoff has publicly stated that it is one of his “favourite things [they’ve] done together”. At the beginning of the “folklore” album, Swift states in the prologue that the album was inspired by “the sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.”
